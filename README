NAME
    Apache::Geo::IP - Look up country by IP Address

SYNOPSIS
    # in httpd.conf 
    # PerlModule Apache::HelloIP 
    #<Location /ip> 
    #   SetHandler perl-script 
    #   PerlHandler Apache::HelloIP 
    #   PerlSetVar GeoIPDBFile "/usr/local/share/geoip/GeoIP.dat" 
    #   PerlSetVar GeoIPFlag Standard 
    #</Location>

    # file Apache::HelloIP

    use Apache::Geo::IP; use strict;

    use Apache::Constants qw(OK);

    sub handler { 
       my $r = Apache::Geo::IP->new(shift);
       $r->content_type('text/plain'); 
       my $country = uc($r->country_code_by_addr());

       $r->print($country);
  
       return OK;
    }

DESCRIPTION
    This module constitutes a mod_perl (both versions 1 and 2) interface 
    to the Geo::IP and Geo::Mirror modules. Geo::IP is used to look up in 
    a database a country of origin of an IP address, while Geo::Mirror
    is used to select a mirror by country from a specified list. See
    the documentation for Apache::Geo::IP and Apache::Geo::Mirror
    for more details.

    The included tests require Apache::Test, which can be obtained
    in the mod_perl-2 sources or in the httpd-test distribution.
    These tests need a network connection to run; some may fail
    due to timeouts upon doing certain name lookups.
