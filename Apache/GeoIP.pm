=head1 NAME

Apache::GeoIP - Look up country by IP Address

=head1 IP ADDRESS TO COUNTRY DATABASES

Free monthly updates to the database are available from 

  http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/

This free database is similar to the database contained in IP::Country, as 
well as many paid databases. It uses ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, and LACNIC whois to 
obtain the IP->Country mappings.

For Win32 users, the F<GeoIP.dat> database file is expected
to reside in the F</Program Files/GeoIP/> directory.

If you require greater accuracy, MaxMind offers a Premium database on a paid 
subscription basis. 

=head1 MAILING LISTS AND CVS

A mailing list and cvs access for the GeoIP library are available 
from SourceForge; see http://sourceforge.net/projects/geoip/.
